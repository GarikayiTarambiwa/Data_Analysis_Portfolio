            <p>This project analysed two different data sets, firstly the CovidDeaths file which provides the total deaths across the globe due to COVID-19. Second Dataset has the corresponding vaccination information. This data was analyzed using sql and visualized using a tableau dashboard.</p>
            <p>This data was obtained from Kaggle and can be accessed <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report"target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

            <p class="image-caption">Fig 1. Sample of Dataset.</p>
            <p>In the period covered by the data, 1,581,210 COVID-19 cases were reported, which signifies that about 2.7 of every 100 individuals contracted the virus. This is the cumulative count until the last recorded date and equates to an infection density of approximately 0.027.</p>
            <p>South Africa specifically had 1,581,210 cases and 54,350 deaths, leading to a death rate of around 3.44%. This means roughly 3.44 of every 100 people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the country succumbed to the virus. In terms of vaccination, South Africa has made significant progress with 283,606 vaccines administered. This figure corresponds to a 'RollingPeopleVaccinatedPerCapita' value of about 0.48, meaning nearly half of every 100 individuals in the country received a vaccine</p>
            <p>When reviewing infection counts and densities globally, the United States had the highest number of cases, but Andorra had the highest infection density. This shows that, in relation to its small population size, Andorra had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases.</p>
            <p>From a continental perspective, North America suffered the highest number of deaths. Globally, the total number of deaths was 1,374,901. </p>
            <p>In total, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused 150,574,977 cases and 3,180,206 deaths worldwide, which amounts to a global death rate of roughly 2.44%. This means that about 2.44 out of every 100 people infected with the virus died.</p>
            <p>The Jupyter Notebook to open the SQL script with the queries used to formulate these insights can be found <a href="https://github.com/GarikayiTarambiwa/Portfolio_Project/blob/main/CovidDataExploration_Project1.sql"target="_blank">here</a>, and the interactive Tableau Dashboard can be accessed <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/garikayi.tarambiwa/viz/CovidDashboard_16866588215600/Dashboard1"target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
